  <summary>Using a shared company Pactflow account?</summary>

:::info
You can use a shared company Pactflow account, but it will make things a bit fiddly, as you'll need to change the identifiers of the various resources that get created so that they don't clash with those from other workshop participants. We've found from past experience running workshops that it's much simpler if everyone has their own account.

   1. In Github:
      1. Open your forked `example-bi-directional-provider` project (`https://github.com/<your-username>/example-bi-directional-provider`)
      1. Click on the `Settings` tab.

## Create a Github Secret to store your Pactflow Base url in.

:::info
ðŸ’¡ We don't need to store this as a secret, but it's the quickest way to get you started. You can also press `.` when viewing any public GitHub repo, and open a live code editor, or swap the your repo from `.com` to `.dev`. Try it [out](https://github.com/github/dev) 
:::

   1. In Pactflow:
      1. Go to Settings > API Tokens.
      1. Click the `COPY PACTFLOW BASE URL` button
   1. In Github:
      1. Open your forked `example-bi-directional-provider` project (`https://github.com/<your-username>/example-bi-directional-provider`)
         1. Open `.github/workflows/build.yml`
         2. Click on the `Settings` tab.
         3. Select `Secrets` from the side menu.
         4. Click `New repository secret` (the button is to the right of the "Actions secrets" heading)
         5. Set the name of the secret to `PACT_BROKER_BASE_URL`
         6. Paste in the Pactflow Base Url value you copied in the previous step.

:::success
You've successfully updated your PACT_BROKER_BASE_URL to be the same as shown in your web browser address bar, when you view your Pactflow account âœ…

## Run the build workflow

**In Github:**

   1. In Github:
      1. Open your forked `example-bi-directional-provider-<tool>` project (`https://github.com/<your-username>/example-bi-directional-provider-<tool>`)
      2. Click on the `Actions` tab.
      3. Click the button with the text "I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them"
      4. Under the `Workflows` menu on the left, select `Build`.
      5. You will see the text `This workflow has a workflow_dispatch event trigger`. To the right of that text is a button with the label `Run workflow`. Click the button.
      6. Leave the branch as `master` and click the green `Run workflow` button.

:::success
This build should now successfully publish the provider contract and evidence, and it will pass on the `can-i-deploy` step before it tries to deploy. This is because the provider has no consumers, so is safe to deploy.

After you have pushed your changes to the workflow files, the provider pipeline will run, fetching and verifying the configured pacts from your Pactflow account, and publishing the results back. The `can-i-deploy` command will pass, and allow the provider to be deployed. âœ…
