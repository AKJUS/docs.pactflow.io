Welcome to your new home ❤️

PactFlow's new user interface is a beautiful and intuitive user experience, optimised around our recommended best practices. 

It has all of the key features you have come to enjoy, with a particular focus on:

1. An application-centric view of the world, to reflect the primary job of developers - creating, updating and maintaining *applications*.
2. Deeper integration of capabilities such `can-i-deploy` into common workflows.
3. Adoption of SmartBear's product design system to improve interoperability with other SmartBear products.

And much more.

## Upgrade to the New User Experience

In the navigation bar of your account, simply click the "Try our new UI" button. You may be required to login again. If you ever need to switch back to the old UI, there is an option to switch back in the navigation bar:

On any page of the new user interface, you can provide us feedback. Click the "take survey" button under the "Switch UI" in navigation. You can complete this survey multiple times as required.
