title: Roles
---

PactFlow comes with a number of default [roles](/docs/permissions/predefined-roles). You can create your own custom roles to customise the role-based access model to your security needs. Some roles, such as the `Team Administrator` role, are not user-editable. These locked roles are denoted by a ðŸ”’ icon.

Only users with the `role:view:*` permission can view all roles.
