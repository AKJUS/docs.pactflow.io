title: Authentication

You can enable SSO user authentication using either Github or Google. Pactflow also supports authenticating
with a SAML IDP on supported plans, please <a href="mailto:support@pactflow.io">email the Pactflow team</a> to enable that.

_NOTE:_ &nbsp; SSO users are autmatically provisioned when they first authenticate.

## GitHub Authentication

For GitHub authentication, you need to configure the GitHub organisations that you would like users who belong to
be able to log into your broker instance.

## Google Authentication

For Google authentication, you must configure the Google hosted domains of the users that will be allowed to
log into your broker instance.
