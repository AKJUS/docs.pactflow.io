![API Token Screen](/ui/api-tokens.png)

**About**
This screen helps you copy and re-generate your API tokens. There are two types of API tokens you can use:

1. The read only token for anything that needs to download pacts. It should be used for a developer's machine.

2. The read-write token for anything required to publish pact files or verification results. It should only be used by your CI when publishing pacts and verification results.

**Buttons**
1. The Copy button allows you to copy the token values without displaying them.

2. The Regenerate button allows you to generate a new value for that token.
