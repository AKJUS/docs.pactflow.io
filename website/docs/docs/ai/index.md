:::note
The PactFlow AI feature is currently in closed beta and is available only to select customers who have joined the [waitlist](https://pactflow.io/ai/). If youâ€™re interested in participating, please [register here](https://pactflow.io/ai/).
:::

## Prerequisites

1. A PactFlow cloud account (you can create a [free account here](https://pactflow.io/try-for-free/))
2. AI feature enabled on your account by SmartBear

## Installation

For *nix users (including Windows users running WSL), use the following command to download and install:

```
curl https://download.pactflow.io/ai/get.sh  | sh
```

Verify the installation by running `pactflow-ai` to ensure it executes successfully.

### Manual installation

Alternatively, download the latest version for your operating system and architecture from the table below. Remember to add it to your environment's `PATH`:

<AiDownloadTable />

## Usage

Running `pactflow-ai --help` will give you the detailed usage for any of the subcommands.

### Authentication

Authentication requires valid PactFlow API Tokens, which can be obtained from the `Settings > Tokens` [page](/docs/user-interface/settings/api-tokens) of your PactFlow account.

There are several ways to authenticate with the CLI:

#### Environment Variables

Export the following environment variables, and the CLI will use these credentials to communicate with PactFlow:

```
export PACT_BROKER_BASE_URL="https://YOUR_ACCOUNT.pactflow.io"
export PACT_BROKER_TOKEN="YOUR_TOKEN"
```

#### Local configuration file

You can also configure the CLI using the following commands:

```
pactflow-ai config set url https://YOUR_ACCOUNT.pactflow.io
pactflow-ai config set token YOUR_TOKEN
```

This will create a `.pactflow.toml` file, which should be added to your `.gitignore`.

#### User configuration file

Alternatively, the user configuration file can be stored in a configuration directory for PactFlow. The paths are `~/.config/pactflow/config.toml` on Unix, and `%APPDATA%\pactflow\config.toml` on Windows.
