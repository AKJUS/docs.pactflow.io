Okta supports using SCIM to manage users and groups in a configured application. Users can be created, updated or 
disabled via the SCIM API (Okta does not support deleting users). For more details, refer to
[connecting SCIM API to Okta](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/scim-provisioning-integration-connect/main/) and the
[Okta SCIM documentation](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/scim/).
