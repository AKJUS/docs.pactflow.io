Our Team Management featue allows you manage the following capabilities:

* Allocate users to teams
* Allocate applications to teams

_NOTE: Editing of teams is restricted to the administrators of the account._

![Teams Management Screen](assets/ui/teams.png)

**New Team** will allow you to create a new team and assign applications to that team.

**Delete Team** allows you to unlink all users and applications from a team and remove it.

**Edit Name & Applications** allows you to change the name and applications of an existing team.

Clicking on the team name will take you to the allocate users screen. 

## Editing or Creating a team

![Edit Team](assets/ui/edit_team.png)

With the team applications, you can search for applications and add them to the team. This allows the users in the team
to be able to filter the main dashboard by those applications.

## Allocating users to a team

![Edit Team Users](assets/ui/edit_team_users.png)

You can search for users by name to add to the team. Clicking the trashcan icon next to a user will remove them from the team.

**Edit** takes you to the edit team dialog, and **Delete** will allow you to delete the team.

You can also switch to other teams from this screen by using the team select box at the top.
